# Chai Culture – Coming Soon Landing Page

This project is a responsive “Coming Soon” landing page built for **Chai Culture**, a premium Indian chai brand inspired by royal traditions and heritage. The goal was to translate the brand’s warmth, elegance, and authenticity into a simple yet refined digital experience.

## Design Approach
The design focuses on warm tones, elegant typography, and subtle motion to evoke a premium and royal feel. Instead of relying heavily on imagery, gradients, spacing, and micro-interactions were used to keep the interface clean, modern, and brand-aligned. The layout is intentionally minimal to ensure clarity and visual balance.
